# ðŸ”’ Environment Variables Security Guide

## Current Status âœ…
- `.env.local` is properly ignored by git (not committed to repository)
- Sensitive credentials are safe from GitHub publication
- Template file (`.env.example`) provided for setup reference

## Environment Files in This Project

### `.env.local` (NEVER COMMITTED)
Contains actual secrets and credentials:
- EmailJS service IDs and API keys
- Compliance password and auth tokens
- Any other sensitive configuration

### `.env.example` (COMMITTED TO REPO)
Template file showing:
- Required environment variable names
- Example structure (without real values)
- Setup guidance for new developers

## Security Best Practices âœ…

### 1. Git Protection
```bash
# .gitignore already includes:
.env*
```
This prevents ANY .env files from being committed.

### 2. Vercel Deployment
For production deployment, add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Add each variable individually
4. Never commit actual values to code

**IMPORTANT**: Vercel will warn about NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables being exposed to browser:
- âœ… **EmailJS variables**: SAFE to expose (designed for client-side use)
- ðŸš¨ **Auth variables**: Must NOT have NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix (server-only secrets)

### 3. Team Sharing
- Share credentials through secure channels (encrypted messages, password managers)
- Never share via email, Slack, or other unsecured methods
- Use `.env.example` as reference for required variables
- **NEVER store actual credentials in documentation or committed files**

## For CVS Capital Compliance Review

### Current Credentials (SECURE - NOT IN REPO):
- Compliance Password: [Stored securely in .env.local only]
- Auth Token: [Stored securely in .env.local only]

### When Going Public:
1. Remove from `.env.local`:
   - `COMPLIANCE_PASSWORD`
   - `AUTH_TOKEN`
2. Delete authentication files:
   - `/src/middleware.ts`
   - `/src/app/auth/` folder
   - `/src/app/api/auth/` folder
3. Site becomes immediately public

## Environment Variable Checklist

### Development Setup:
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Fill in actual values (never commit these)
- [ ] Verify `.env.local` not showing in `git status`
- [ ] Ensure AUTH_TOKEN and COMPLIANCE_PASSWORD are set (required for auth to work)

### Production Deployment:
- [ ] Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Test all functionality with production env vars
- [ ] Verify no secrets in repository code

### Security Audit:
- [ ] `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [ ] Template file available for team setup
- [ ] Production secrets configured in deployment platform
